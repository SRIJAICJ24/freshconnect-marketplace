# 📝 Repository Name Change

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: New Repository Name

Since you already have a GitHub repository named **"freshconnect"**, all deployment documentation has been updated to use:

## 🆕 New Repository Name:
```
freshconnect-marketplace
```

---

## ✅ What Changed:

All deployment files now use **`freshconnect-marketplace`** instead of `freshconnect-app`:

### Updated Files:
- ✅ `DEPLOY_COMMANDS.txt`
- ✅ `QUICK_DEPLOY.md`
- ✅ `DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.txt`
- ✅ `RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`

---

## 🚀 Deploy Commands (Updated):

### Step 1: Git Init
```bash
cd C:\Users\LENOVO\CascadeProjects\windsurf-project\freshconnect-app
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Ready for deployment"
```

### Step 2: Create GitHub Repo
```
Go to: https://github.com/new
Name: freshconnect-marketplace  ← NEW NAME!
```

### Step 3: Push to GitHub
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/freshconnect-marketplace.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 4: Deploy on Railway
```
1. Go to: https://railway.app
2. Login with GitHub
3. Select: freshconnect-marketplace  ← NEW NAME!
```

---

## 🎯 Your Live URL Will Be:
```
https://freshconnect-marketplace-production.up.railway.app
```

Instead of:
```
https://freshconnect-app-production.up.railway.app  ← OLD
```

---

## 📋 Why the Change?

- You already have a repo named "freshconnect"
- Using "freshconnect-marketplace" avoids conflicts
- Clearly identifies this as the marketplace app
- Professional naming convention

---

## ✅ Next Steps:

Just follow the updated commands in:
- **`DEPLOY_COMMANDS.txt`** (fastest - copy/paste)
- **`QUICK_DEPLOY.md`** (5-min guide)
- **`RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`** (detailed guide)

All files already updated with new name! 🎉

---

**No other changes needed - just use the new repository name!**
